		Tail Recursion
		
		+ If a function calls itself as its last
			action, the functionâ€™s stack frame can be reused. This is called tail recursion.

		+ Tail recursive functions are iterative processes.

		+ In general, if the last action of a function consists of calling a
			function (which may be the same), one stack frame would be
			sufficient for both functions. Such calls are called tail-calls.
